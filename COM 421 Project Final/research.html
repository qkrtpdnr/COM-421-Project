    <h2>Starting Your Research</h2>
    <p>Effective research begins with a realistic topic—one that is both interesting to you and manageable within your time frame. Before you dive in, evaluate how much information exists about your subject and whether it aligns with your assignment’s purpose.</p>

    <h2>Finding Sources</h2>
    <p>Access the IIT Library database through your myIIT portal. From there, search through databases like Academic Search Premier and IEEE Xplore. You can also use I-Share and interlibrary loan (ILL) to request materials not immediately available in IIT’s collection.</p>

    <aside>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use advanced search filters to narrow by date, peer-review status, or publication type.</p>

    <h2>Evaluating Information</h2>
    <p>Always consider the credibility, relevance, and bias of your sources. Evaluate an author’s qualifications and whether their work is supported by evidence. When using web sources, look for official or educational domains (.gov, .edu).</p>

    <h2>Organizing References</h2>
    <p>Maintain a running list of citations as you research. Citation management tools such as Zotero or EndNote can save time and help you format your bibliography correctly later on.</p>

    <h2>Research Timeline</h2>
    <p>Plan your schedule backward from the due date. Allocate time for locating, reading, note-taking, and integrating sources into your draft. Build in buffer days for delayed interlibrary loan requests or other obstacles.</p>
